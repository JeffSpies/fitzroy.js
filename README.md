FitzRoy.js
==========

A History.js based JavaScript router using Finch.js for making single-page websites

Why is this library named FitzRoy?
----------------------------------

FitzRoy.js uses [History.js](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/) and [Finch.js](http://stoodder.github.io/finchjs/). History and finches led to thoughts of Darwin, his [Voyage of the Beagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Beagle), and the role of the [finches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's_finches) collected during the voyage in his theory of evolution. The captain (i.e. navigator; i.e., router) of the  [HMS Beagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Beagle) was [Captain Robert FitzRoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_FitzRoy). Q.E.D.
