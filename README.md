FitzRoy.js
==========

A History.js based JavaScript router using Finch.js for making single-page websites

Why is this library named FitzRoy?
----------------------------------

FitzRoy.js uses History.js and Finch.js. History and finches remind me of Darwin and his Voyage of the Beagle. Captain FitzRoy was the captain (i.e. navigator; i.e. router) of the HMS Beagle. Thus, I present to you, FitzRoy.js. Q.E.D.
